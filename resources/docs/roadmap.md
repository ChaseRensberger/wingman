# Roadmap

A list of things that I am working on/thinking about. If you have a request of something you'd like to be added, put up a PR adding it to this file.

## Backlog

- Easily translate between a WingmanInferenceConfig and a ProviderInferenceConfig
- Better error support for rate limits, exceeding context, etc...
- Fleets
- Formations
- Improved logging
- Make model config unique CRUD resource for reusing configurations
- clean up build provider in session handler
- need this to work offline so either maintain private model dir or snapshot models.dev


## Providers to add

- OpenAI
- Gemini
- OpenCode Zen
