# Wingman

Wingman is a highly performant agent orchestration framework written in pure Go. This project is heavily inspired by [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and specifically OpenCode's client & server approach to running agents. I wanted to build my own version of OpenCode's server but with improved performance and opinionated decisions about how agents should be run/composed together.

## Installation
