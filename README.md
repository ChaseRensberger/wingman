# Wingman

Wingman is a highly performant agent orchestration framework written in pure Go. This project is heavily inspired by [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and specifically OpenCode's client & server approach to running agents. I wanted to build my own version of OpenCode's server but with improved performance and opinionated decisions about how agents should be run/composed together.

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://wingman.actor/install | bash
```

## Documentation

Check out the [docs site](https://wingman.actor/docs) for more detailed information about Wingman's primitives, architecture, and usage patterns. The docs site is also generated from [the docs folder](.resources/docs) if that's more your style.
