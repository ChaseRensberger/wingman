# Roadmap

A list of things that I am working on/thinking about. If you have a request of something you'd like to be added, put up a PR adding it to this file.

- Easily translate between a WingmanInferenceConfig and a ProviderInferenceConfig
- Better error support for rate limits, exceeding context, etc...
- Fleets
- Formations
- Improved logging
