## How to do a ticket

1. Create and checkout to new branch with a meaningful name (unless already on one)
2. Gather context from the codebase, `./resources/docs` is probably the best place to start
3. Build! Ask questions when in doubt about anything
4. Put up a PR pointed at main with no description (may need to create upstream branch if branch didn't exist yet): `gh pr create --title "{meaningful title}" --head {your-branch} --base main --body ""`
